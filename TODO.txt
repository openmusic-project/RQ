;;;;; TODO LIST ;;;;;

=============
Short Term :
=============

- COMMENT AND CLEAN THE CODE ! make sure every function has a description

=============
Long Term :
=============


Implementation :

- Use threads in order to run the algorithm in background, and not block the interface during the computations
- "Expert" interface in order to be able to specify each complexity coefficient (maybe not, cf Florent's work)
- Limit recursions in order to be able to process longer units without "stack overflow"
- Use gn-chords to display gracenotes correctly, and treat them differently than a regular chord with offset (in particular, adapt get-cons-list function so that we differenciate grace notes and chords. Current implementation has to do that in order to get the same results when a grace note is selected in "chord" mode or in "group" mode)


Research :

- Adapt the algorithm to polyphony
- Tempo curves
